This document tracks the results of our comparison tests between sequential thoughts implementations.

## Test Cases Results

### Test Case 1: Simple Mathematical Problem
*Question: Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100*

#### Sequential Thoughts Results
```
Thought 1: First, let me understand what we're looking for: we need to find all even numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and sum them up. Even numbers are those divisible by 2 with no remainder.

Thought 2: The even numbers in this range would be 2, 4, 6, ..., 98, 100. We can generate this sequence by starting at 2 and adding 2 each time until we reach 100. This gives us 50 numbers in total (because 100/2 = 50).

Thought 3: There's a faster way to calculate this. Since we have an arithmetic sequence with 50 numbers, first term a₁=2, and last term a₅₀=100, we can use the arithmetic sequence sum formula: Sum = n(a₁ + aₙ)/2, where n is the number of terms. Here, n=50, a₁=2, and a₅₀=100.

Thought 4: Plugging into the formula: Sum = 50(2 + 100)/2 = 50 × 102/2 = 50 × 51 = 2550. Therefore, the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550.
```

#### Sequential Thoughts-Custom Results
```
Thought 1 (insight): To find the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100, I need to first identify the numbers involved and determine the most efficient approach to calculate their sum.

Thought 2 (evidence): The even numbers in this range are those divisible by 2: 2, 4, 6, ..., 98, 100. I notice this forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2.

Thought 3 (evidence): Let me identify the key parameters: First term (a₁) = 2, Last term (aₙ) = 100. To find n (number of terms), I can use the arithmetic sequence formula: aₙ = a₁ + (n-1)d, where d=2. Solving 100 = 2 + (n-1)2 gives us n = 50 terms.

Thought 4 (evidence): I can now apply the arithmetic sequence sum formula: Sₙ = n(a₁ + aₙ)/2. Substituting our values: S₅₀ = 50(2 + 100)/2 = 50 × 102/2 = 50 × 51.

Thought 5 (conclusion): Computing the final result: 50 × 51 = 2550. Therefore, the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550. I can verify this is correct because we used a proven mathematical formula and executed the calculations carefully.

### Test Case 2: Complex Problem Solving
*Question: A train leaves Station A at 2:00 PM traveling west at 60 mph. Another train leaves Station B at 3:30 PM traveling east at 75 mph. If the stations are 390 miles apart, at what time will the trains meet?*

#### Sequential Thoughts Results
```
Thought 1: Let's break down the train problem. We have:
- Train A: starts at 2:00 PM, going west at 60 mph
- Train B: starts at 3:30 PM, going east at 75 mph
- Distance between stations: 390 miles
Key observation: Train B starts 1.5 hours after Train A

Thought 2: During the 1.5 hours before Train B starts, Train A travels:
60 mph × 1.5 hours = 90 miles westward
So when Train B starts at 3:30 PM:
- Distance between trains = 390 - 90 = 300 miles

Thought 3: After 3:30 PM, the trains are moving toward each other:
- Combined speed = 60 mph + 75 mph = 135 mph
- Remaining distance = 300 miles
To find time needed: Distance ÷ Speed = 300 ÷ 135 = 2.22... hours

Thought 4: Converting 0.22... hours to minutes:
0.22... × 60 = 13.33... minutes ≈ 13 minutes
So the trains will meet 2 hours and 13 minutes after 3:30 PM

Thought 5: Therefore, the trains will meet at 5:43 PM (3:30 PM + 2 hours and 13 minutes)
```

#### Sequential Thoughts-Custom Results
```
Thought 1 (insight): This is a two-part problem where we need to: 1) Calculate Train A's position when Train B starts, and 2) Calculate how long it takes for the trains to meet given their speeds and remaining distance. Let me break this down systematically.

Thought 2 (evidence): Train A starts at 2:00 PM, and Train B starts at 3:30 PM. This means Train A travels alone for 1.5 hours. During this time, Train A covers: Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 1.5 hours = 90 miles westward.

Thought 3 (evidence): At 3:30 PM when Train B starts:
Initial distance: 390 miles
Train A's travel: 90 miles
Remaining distance between trains = 390 - 90 = 300 miles

Thought 4 (evidence): From 3:30 PM onwards:
Combined speed = Train A speed + Train B speed = 60 mph + 75 mph = 135 mph
Time to meet = Remaining distance ÷ Combined speed = 300 miles ÷ 135 mph = 2.22... hours

Thought 5 (evidence): Converting the decimal hours to hours and minutes:
2.22... hours = 2 hours + (0.22... × 60 minutes)
0.22... × 60 = 13.33... minutes ≈ 13 minutes
Therefore, they will meet 2 hours and 13 minutes after 3:30 PM

Thought 6 (conclusion): The trains will meet at 5:43 PM. We can verify this is correct:
- Train A travels for 3 hours 43 minutes total (223 miles)
- Train B travels for 2 hours 13 minutes total (167 miles)
- Total distance covered = 223 + 167 = 390 miles (matches initial distance)
The solution is verified.

1. Education reform emphasizing adaptable skills
2. Robust retraining programs for displaced workers
3. Investment in AI research and development
4. Updated labor laws and social safety nets
5. Support for AI adoption in small businesses
6. Ethical guidelines for AI deployment
The effectiveness of these measures will significantly influence transition outcomes.

Thought 7 (conclusion): The next decade will see substantial job market transformation due to AI, but not wholesale replacement of human workers. Key conclusions:
1. Job displacement will be significant but gradual, allowing for adaptation
2. New job creation will partially offset losses, but require substantial reskilling
3. Success depends on proactive policy measures and education reform
4. Economic benefits will be substantial but require careful distribution management
5. Regional and socioeconomic disparities need active management
This analysis suggests a challenging but manageable transition requiring coordinated action from government, business, and educational institutions.

### Test Case 5: Error Recovery
*Question: If x + 2y = 15 and 2x - y = 3, solve for x and y. Then use these values to calculate 3x + 4y*

#### Sequential Thoughts Results
```
Thought 1: Given equations:
1. x + 2y = 15
2. 2x - y = 3
Let me solve this system using substitution method. From equation 2: y = 2x - 3

Thought 2: Substituting y = 2x - 3 into equation 1:
x + 2(2x - 3) = 15
x + 4x - 6 = 15
5x - 6 = 15
5x = 21
x = 21/5 = 4.2

Thought 3: Now I can find y by substituting x = 4.2 back into y = 2x - 3:
y = 2(4.2) - 3
y = 8.4 - 3
y = 5.4

Thought 4: Let me verify the solution (x = 4.2, y = 5.4) in both original equations:
1. 4.2 + 2(5.4) = 4.2 + 10.8 = 15 ✓
2. 2(4.2) - 5.4 = 8.4 - 5.4 = 3 ✓
Solutions verified correct.

Thought 5: Now I can calculate 3x + 4y:
3x + 4y = 3(4.2) + 4(5.4)
= 12.6 + 21.6
= 34.2
```

#### Sequential Thoughts-Custom Results
```
Thought 1 (insight): We need to solve a system of two equations:
1. x + 2y = 15
2. 2x - y = 3
Then use the values to calculate 3x + 4y. I'll use substitution method since we can easily isolate y in the second equation.

Thought 2 (evidence): Step 1: Solve for y in equation 2
2x - y = 3
-y = 3 - 2x
y = 2x - 3

Step 2: Substitute into equation 1
x + 2(2x - 3) = 15
x + 4x - 6 = 15
5x - 6 = 15
5x = 21
x = 4.2

Thought 3 (evidence): Step 3: Calculate y using x = 4.2
y = 2x - 3
y = 2(4.2) - 3
y = 8.4 - 3
y = 5.4
Solution: x = 4.2, y = 5.4

Thought 4 (evidence): Verification:
Equation 1: x + 2y = 15
4.2 + 2(5.4) = 4.2 + 10.8 = 15 ✓
Equation 2: 2x - y = 3
2(4.2) - 5.4 = 8.4 - 5.4 = 3 ✓
Both equations satisfied, solution is correct.

Thought 5 (conclusion): Final calculation: 3x + 4y
3(4.2) + 4(5.4)
= 12.6 + 21.6
= 34.2
Therefore, when x = 4.2 and y = 5.4, the expression 3x + 4y equals 34.2
